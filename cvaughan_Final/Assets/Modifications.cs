1.) Changed out textures/materials, specifically lava mat in order to make sure there were no premade materials, shaders or prefabs.
2.) Modified directional light intensity and color to cast a more dark-red tone overall.
3.) Created complex 3D object for player model and reimplemented player controller and camera to match up. Modified run speed, jump speed, etc.
4.) Made a fog with a pinkish hue.
5.) Added and modified skybox to be bigger, bolder, and contain red and orange hues.
6.) Deleted 2 of the finish zones in order to make one into prefab. Created 2 variants and placed instances of the prefab with different colors.
7.) 

Need to haves:
- extra obstacles
    . barriers that respawn player

Nice to haves:
- Tophat on Player
- destructible barriers
- ability to throw snowballs that destroy barriers
