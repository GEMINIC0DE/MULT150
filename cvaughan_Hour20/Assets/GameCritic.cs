1.) The game isn't neccessarily too easy, but it is simplistic. It definitely leans on the easy side due to the overall speed of the objects and the player speed.
    The game gives you adequate time to move out of the way of the obstacles it spawns without making the player too fast, and allows you to phase out if you aren't 
    able to get out of the way in time.
2.) I feel that in order to make it easier OR harder, you'd need to change some mechanics at a macro-level. For instance, to make it harder you could add a dimension
    above the player where obstacles would need to be ducked under. But in order to do that, you'd need to add additional functionality to the player's available movement
    so that they could actually duck and jump. This sort of renders the phasing out obsolete though. And while the changing of the materials is cool, it would need to be
    changed up somehow.
3.) If the level could somehow "progress" through different stages as you went along, I think that would be a wow factor. I'm imagining a dynamic background/backdrop(skybox maybe?)
    that is slowly moving along as the player continues to push forward. Then it transitions into a different backdrop, perhaps an entirely new theme. Additionally, when 
    the background has transitioned, new obstacles and powerups begin to spawn which create a variable challenge with each theme progression.
4.) So, this may sound strange, but I think the two parts that are fun are also the two parts that become tedious. But that is to be expected when practicing creating games at
    this level due to the nature of an inro course. They're supposed to be simple enough to get through and still have a functioning game. But I'll try to make the answers different.
    Trying to get all the powerups is fun, and I also like the slowing down of time aspect as well. The time slowdown was a pleasant and unexpected feature to work with.
5.) As stated previously, I think that while I like collected the powerups and the time slowdown, they both become tedious after several playthroughs. So I'll say that the fact
    that the player can't actually jump makes it feel sort of tedious. And the lack of variation of obstacles and powerups can make it feel tedious as well.
